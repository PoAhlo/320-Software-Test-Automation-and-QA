# CS-320 Software Test Automation and QA
#### How can I ensure that my code, program, and software is functional and secure?
This class focused on the testing aspect of this question.  To verify that the code is logically sound, functional, and secure, I ran tests.  These tests tested both valid and invalid inputs and confirmed that the program requirements were met.

#### How do I interpret user needs and incorperate them into a program?
I take the user needs and break them down into small segments that we can use as requirements for a program.  For example, if a client wanted to get the user's contact information, I can break that down that down into first name, last name, phone, and address.  In the Contact class, I tested for those requirements.

#### How do I approach designing software?
I collect requirements to plan out what I need to do, use that plan to write the code and test the product.  Testing the software is done throughout the development process.
